									<h3> Research the Company Before the Interview</h3>
									<p>Research the company prior to the interview.Hiring managers know that they’re dealing with someone who is serious about the position when the candidate has taken the time to research the company.For startup companies, try to find out who the investors and partners are, as well as how much money they have raised so far. Be aware that a startup job may not be long term (should the new business fail), </p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<span class="fa fa-wrench"></span>
									<h3>Plan What You’re Going to Wear</h3>
									<p>First impressions are the most important in job interviews.The safe bet is to dress professionally, paying attention to grooming, soothing colors, and tasteful accessories.If you’re actively seeking employment, have a couple of interview outfits ready. That will help avoid the stress of figuring out what you’re going wear at the last minute.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<span class="fa fa-leaf"></span>
									<h3>Practice Interview Techniques and Responses</h3>
									<p>Employers will try to challenge interviewees with tough questions to judge their compatibility and to see how they cope under pressure. Expect questions about work experiences, stressful moments, difficult decisions, and where you see yourself in several years.While no one wants to hire someone who acts mechanically and comes across as too rehearsed, feeling prepared can help you to feel confident enough to be yourself.

									<h3>Make a Pit Stop</h3>
									<p>If you’re stressed and there’s a rest room you can use before you go to the interview, stop in and take a few deep breaths to calm down. Wash and dry your hands to minimize sweaty palms.If you are a coffee drinker or smoker, or you have a meal before an interview, use a mint or brush your teeth before starting.It is good if you don't smoke before your interview.You can keep some mints in your pocket.Foul smell can make negetive impact as well to your performance.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<span class="fa fa-wrench"></span>
									<h3>Arrive Early, But Not Too Early</h3>
									<p>Arrive for your interview about 5-10 minutes early. Good employers value punctuality, and if you arrive even a minute late, you will likely give a poor first impression. Arriving more than 10 minutes early can put undue pressure on the interviewer, especially if they have a number of interviews to get through in the day.Rushing will negatively affect your interview performance.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<span class="fa fa-leaf"></span>
									<h3>Be Aware of Your Body Language</h3>
									<p>Remember to exude confidence—hold your head high, stand straight and tall, hold a slight smile, and relax. Introduce yourself with a smile, a reasonably firm handshake, and a relaxed and self-assured demeanor.Greet others, and if you’re interviewing with more than one person, follow the interviewer’s lead to sit down or move to another room. Do your best to enjoy the interaction as much as possible.</p>

									<h3>Prepare for Behavioral Interview Questions</h3>
									<p>Employers use behavioral questions to dig into past achievements and to predict future performance. Behavioral questions are those that give the interviewer insight into your personality and emotional intelligence in the workplace.These questions identify applicants' key competencies and skills, so it’s vital to prepare answers to match your skills to the employer’s requirements</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<span class="fa fa-wrench"></span>
									<h3>Have Questions Ready to Ask</h3>
									<p>A job interview is an investigation into your experience, achievements, and compatibility with the company culture. But it's also your opportunity to find out if the company is a good fit for you. You can demonstrate your intelligence and communication skills (active listening) by asking thoughtful questions.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<span class="fa fa-leaf"></span>
									<h3>Don’t Ask About Salary or Benefits</h3>
									<p>Don’t bring up salary on your first interview, unless the employer brings it up first. If they ask what you're making at your current place of employment, provide an exact salary or a salary range. If appropriate, you can mention that you feel it might be premature to talk salary. What is most important in the first interview is getting a sense of compatibility between yourself and the company.</p>
